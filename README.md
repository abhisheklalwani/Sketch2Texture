# TextureGANExploration
This repository highlights the development of the pre-processing and the dataset generation pipeline of my research at the Computer Vision Lab, University of Massachusetts Amherst. 

I am working under the supervision of Professor Subhransu Maji to develop TextureGAN, a generative network for generating realistic textures from basic human-drawn sketches.

We have explored multiple generator architectures for this purpose, with our primary focus on Pix2Pix and StyleGAN.

Research corresponding to Pix2Pix can be found here - https://github.com/abhisheklalwani/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix

Research corresponding to StyleGAN will be documented on github hopefully by the end of this month.
